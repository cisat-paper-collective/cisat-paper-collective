# cisat-paper-collective
Affiliated with the Center for Information Systems &amp; Technology at CGU, a repository for storing papers that have been presented/discussed and a springboard to collaborations on implementations and research.

Please help keep this space organized by creating a folder for the general topic of the paper you are adding, and within that folder updating a readme.txt file to include the following info:
- hyperlinked title of the paper (linked to where the paper can be accessed)
- indented after the title:
    - key insights/why you like the paper
    - if you are actively seeking collaborators in this area to practice/implement elements or extensions of the paper you may create a [github team](https://docs.github.com/en/organizations/organizing-members-into-teams/creating-a-team) and link to the team here

- [The Correctness-Security Gap in Compiler Optimizations](https://doi.org/10.1109/SPW.2015.33)
  - Looks at correct optimizations done by compilers that introduce security risks
  - Outline a number of clear, easy to understand examples of scenarios of where optimizations defeat security techniques
  - Provide recommendations for future work on including security in the idea of "correctness" of compiler code changes
  - read more about a popular optimizing compiler, LLVM, [here](https://llvm.org/)
